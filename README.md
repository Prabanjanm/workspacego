# WorkspaceGo

WorkspaceGo is an AI-powered cloud workspace solution designed to help college students securely access their personal working environment from any device when their laptop is unavailable.

## Problem
Students depend heavily on personal laptops for labs, assignments, coding, and projects. Forgetting or losing a laptop disrupts productivity and academic continuity.

## Solution
WorkspaceGo uses an AI agent to automatically sync a student’s workspace to the cloud. Students can securely access their workspace through a browser using a temporary cloud session with automatic logout and zero data leakage.

## Key Features
- AI-automated workspace sync
- Browser-based access from any device
- Secure and temporary cloud sessions
- Owner-only authentication
- Campus-scale deployment ready

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Google Cloud Run
- Google Cloud Storage
- Firebase Authentication
- Google Compute Engine
- Google Gemini (AI agent support)

## Project Status
🚧 Prototype development planned during hackathon implementation phase.
